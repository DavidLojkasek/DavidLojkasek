Hi! I am currently working as an equity analyst for WOOD & Company based in Prague, Czech Republic.
### About me
I have begun learning to code in 2020, during the COVID-19-related lockdowns, and I'm interested mostly in Python and SQL. I've already started working on some side 
projects and automated some repetative tasks in Python.
